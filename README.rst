Zen of Programming
==================

Hello hello, welcome to the ``Zen of Programming`` git repository!

According to it's maintainers, this repository is kept up to date so that
individuals can learn various programming principles, best practices, and
programming paradigms in their own time. 

.. note::

    Regular updates to the repository should be made in order to advance and
    broaden the body of information and ideas pertaining to programming. Also,
    the concepts here won't cover the installation guides for different
    programming languages as different users have different preferences.

.. attention::
    
    This repository's programming languages and concepts are mostly drawn from
    the maintainer's Master's in Artificial Intelligence curriculum at the
    `DePaul University`_.
